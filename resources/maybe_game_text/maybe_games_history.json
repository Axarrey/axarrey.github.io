The sequel to Suikoden 4, probably the most disliked one out of the entire series (and probably why nobody has played this).<br><br> I remember this being an enjoyable Tactics experience however, with some neat area effects (elements on ground interact with character standing on tile, etc.) Would enjoy a revisit!",
