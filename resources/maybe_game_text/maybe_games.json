The anime released alongside this is one of the first examples of Isekai that I can think of. That should tell you everything you need to know!<br><br> Note: If this game happens, it will not be a full playthrough. Very menu heavy in a not-fun way, but I'd like to show it off for a bit as a novelty game (for the time, and for me)",

Paradigm system is still there, but now you only play as one character and change outfits instead, each with its own ATB bar. ATB is now a resource that charges like you'd expect it to, and is used like MP. Frequent switching to resource manage/recover or to set up combos. Just a joy to play.",

With the 'maybe game' vote you can specify either Claude or Rena as protag. If empty, my choice.",
