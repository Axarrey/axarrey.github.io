Paradigm system is still there, but now you only play as one character and change outfits instead, each with its own ATB bar. ATB is now a resource that charges like you'd expect it to, and is used like MP. Frequent switching to resource manage/recover or to set up combos. Just a joy to play.",

With the 'maybe game' vote you can specify either Claude or Rena as protag. If empty, my choice.",
