                    <li>Starting out, people mentioned playing FF14 without having played any or barely any other Final Fantasies before! Just a surprise to me tbh. Where does the interest come from?</li>
                    <li>We had a few small conversations around a chat-comment stating that Final Fantasies seem/are generic, and we ended up talking a little bit about how broad the series is in terms of appeal and how a lot of them are appreciably different from each other in terms of combat mechanics or character builds. Also discussed by folks: Main character looks, personalities, etc. Are Cloud and Tidus the same person?</li>

                    <li>Illforgetthisname mentioned that Final Fantasies 9, 10, and 11 were all announced on the same day! After a quick google, it apparently happened at a “Square Millenium Festival” on the first of February 2000. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/01/square-millennium-event-final-fantasy-ix-x-and-xi-revealed" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine">Article</a> </li>

                    <li>Taylor & Peebs talked about how they adore returning series conventions - Nostalgia bait incarnate or are they just all damn good designs? My heart wants the latter to be true.</li>
                    <li>Boris mentioned how to raise weapon skills in FF2 easily - by equipping a shield, attacking with it (which does no damage to enemies) and then switching it back to the weapon at the end of the fight. Thanks!</li>
                    <li>Whisperdraw talked a lot of interesting stuff about fighting games - random stun amount of attacks in Street Fighter 2, no stun gauge to gauge stun progress, how Mortal Kombat moved the “stun” to the end of the fight as a victory thing with Fatalities. He also mentioned that, to him, “combat is the lens through which you can focus your energy on improvement”, which I understood to mean not just focusing on improvement in the game itself to get better at it for the sake of it, but rather simply wanting to focus your own energy on the thought of improvement in general (as in, not limited to the game), which makes a lot of sense to me given that fighting games are nothing but improvement over a long period of time. Thank you for that insight!</li>
                    <li>The story of Vii’s brother deleting their save of FF1 so they could never get very far shall forever be immortalized here. Rest in peace, progress!</li>

                    <li>Squaerio mentioned that, in certain games, there is missmatch between a spell/skill created around a character's class/personality/character and how useful it actually is. A worthless skill special to a character can be a noteable design flaw.</li>
                    <li>Thordoesathing returns to Twitch to be kind to everyone! Thanks again for all those gifts!</li>
                    <li>Zebobz and Profoundbadness told me about how D&D spells work - how there’s cantrips that can be cast without the use of spell slots, how spells can be cast with higher slots to make the effect stronger (by adding more dice to the roll the higher the slot is, etc.). They also mentioned how certain classes in D&D are made more diverse by different sub-classes, or how there’s a ton of utility abilities that can be roleplayed with, or how JRPGs could use a major/minor actions system - just a generally enjoyable conversation about D&D and its applications - thanks guys! </li>
                    <li>According to Illforgetthisname, the INT stat in this game is actually broken! </li>
                    <li>Portablejerkops rightfully pointed out that the casting animations in this game look like a blowjob animation! Sorry, had to be in here.</li>

                <summary style="padding-left: 2rem">As a streamed game</summary>
                <div class="summary-text-area" style="padding-top: 1rem">
                    Streaming this game was a pleasant surprise, to be honest. I initially started playing this not to enjoy it, but to have a look at where the series started. Thankfully, the game, and more specifically this version of it, was interesting enough in terms of gameplay and dungeon design to cause a few discussions that likely would not have cropped up otherwise, such as the D&D discussions or the dungeon layouts discussion. 
                    <br><br>
                    I had thought that it would be a very barebones experience to get through, but it ended up being a fairly enjoyable one instead! I largely didn’t feel like I wasn’t progressing or wasting my time too much, or having streams that were just devoted to finding out where to go next. On this point, I will add that I still roughly remembered where to go next after not having completed it again since 2010. If this had not been the case, I likely would have had to spend more time talking to NPCs or looking up guides. However, NPCs did seem to have helpful dialogue, so general story-point to story-point progression shouldn’t cause too much frustration, even without the prior knowledge. 
                    <br><br>
                    What’s likely to cause some friction, however, is the difficulty/balancing of this version, or rather the “normal” difficulty that is not present in the more recent GBA and PSP releases, as those are based on the “easy” difficulty of the PS1 release. That, in combination with the lack of save points in dungeons as well as some deliberately awfully placed severely-harder-than-usual encounters, can easily lead to loss of progression.
                    <br><br>
                    Another factor to consider for streams is the opportunity for backseating/spoilers: Final Fantasy 1 is very light on story, such that there is not much to be spoiled. Backseating opportunities certainly exist, but those were limited to equipment choices in my experience. Other reasons for backseating that I could see would be the “Job” picks at the start of the game, as those do make quite the impact on the playthrough. Additionally, where to go after completing an objective is not obvious, either. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, I enjoyed streaming this game and would not have enjoyed it as much had I played the game on my own.

                <summary style="padding-left: 2rem">Thoughts on the game itself</summary>
                <div class="summary-text-area" style="padding-top: 1rem">
                    Over the last few years, I’ve started playing certain games with a somewhat bigger focus on getting something lasting out of them. This can be in the form of trying to understand exactly why it is that I enjoy specific gameplay systems more than others, or to gain an appreciation for a game’s mechanics by attempting to understand how they interact with each other. I find this fun on its own, but, honestly,  the “ultimate” goal is to eventually get creative with all the gained knowledge. That’s a topic for another day, though. 
                    <br><br>
                    A series that has been with me since my early childhood days is Final Fantasy - I still love remembering playing Final Fantasy 4 on my GBA and getting to Mount Ordeals, figuring out how to beat the trial there, and getting my little kid mind blown after hours upon hours of the regular combat experience forging my expectations as well as my behaviour of “press A to win”. 
                    <br><br>
                    After beating it, I eventually moved on to the Dawn of Souls combo pack of Final Fantasy 1 & 2, because apparently kid-me realized that these games are connected in some capacity. While these games aren’t directly tied to 4, I did end up enjoying them nonetheless. I honestly cannot remember any details, but growing up, I’ve always had the sense that 1 in particular is just an enjoyable experience, which a lot of other people have echoed in the years since. There’s also the ace enemy and player character sprites that the game comes with. Have you seen the Knight and the Red Wizard sprites? If not, you should go see them. In fact, here you go:
                    <br><br>
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction:row; justify-content: flex-start">
                        <img src="resources/knight_ff1.png" alt="Knight as he appears in FF1 Origin" style="display: inline; margin-right: 1rem">
                        <img src="resources/red_wizard_ff1.png" alt="Red Wizard as he appears in FF1 Origin" style="display: inline">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    Pretty neat, right? The Knight in particular has remained with me as an image that invokes a certain “cool” and “powerful” feeling, the latter of which definitely has basis in the reality of FF1’s balancing, which we’ll get to in a bit.
                    <br><br>
                    For the here and now, I want to mention that I’ve been curious about revisiting the series for a while now, seeing as it is essentially the point of origin for my fondness for turn-based games. So, I decided to go back to it and explore said origin with Final Fantasy Origins! 
                    <br><br>
                    Not soon after hitting New Game, I got my first surprise: Unlike the GBA and PSP releases, this version’s magic users do not use MP to cast magic like you would in other Final Fantasy games. Instead, each caster has a growing amount of spell charges of different levels or ranks - you start out with level 1 spell charges and eventually get to level 8 spell charges through simply leveling your character up (spell charge level =|= character level). How many charges you gain throughout the game is fixed, i.e. you will always have the same amount of charges on a character of the same level and class in subsequent playthroughs. Each spell level is capped at a maximum of 9 charges. 
                    <br><br>
                    Upon first glance, this system was a bit reminiscent of how D&D does spells. However, this game’s spells are of a fixed spell charge level. Fire1 will always remain a Level 1 spell and uses up one level 1 charge upon use, Nuke will always be a Level 8 spell, etc. Additionally, a caster can only learn 3 spells of each charge level, which can be an issue if the spells on offer all have their uses, which is often the case.
                    <br><br>
                    Something that I have neglected to mention thus far: Spells are purchased in towns - the mages will not be learning them naturally. There’s also usually 4 or more for each charge level, meaning you have to make the choice to not learn one or multiple of them (unless, of course, you have multiple mages). You can, however, unlearn an already purchased spell to make space for another. I don’t believe I ever did this, for reasons I will get into later.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond the unfamiliar magic system, the game also started me off essentially naked. No equipment and no spells, and only a few hundred Gil to buy starting equipment with. This "what to buy with our starting money" choice was, again, a bit reminiscent of D&D. If this allusion was intentional, it unfortunately was a bit of a poor one. Due to the lack of spell charges as well as the mostly single-target focused spells available at the start of the game, it made very little sense to me to buy magic immediately, unless I wanted to pay very frequent visits to the admittedly cheap inn. While this point on its own was obviously not an issue at all, I do think it is rather funny remembering that I actually was a bit conflicted about magic pretty much from the get-go. The game wasted no time to introduce a point of friction through a choice that wasn’t much of one at all.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately for me, the issues with magic continued throughout the game. At this stage, I highly recommend having a look at the spell charge progression for any kind of mage. I have one for you here, if you’re curious: <a href="http://www.fforigins.com/ff1/char/bmage.html" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine"> Click this for a breakdown of the NES Black Mage.</a> While I cannot guarantee that this is the same as it is in the Origin version, it does seem accurate to me. This site, by the way, also has an ace world map that shows which enemies are fought in which grid cell. If you’re curious, click on this link: <a href="http://www.fforigins.com/ff1/maps/enemymap/" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine">Map</a>
                    <br><br>
                    To illustrate an issue that persisted throughout the game: I would arrive at a new town, find useful (and expensive, prohibitively so) spells and equipment to purchase, but would have, at the absolute best of times, 1 or 2 charges of that level available to me at the point where I arrived at the new location. Let’s take a concrete example: Arriving at Elfheim at level 4 allowed me to learn exactly 0 of the spells on offer, as I did not have a level 3 slot available to me at the time. Leveling up while going through the areas around Elfheim eventually got me to level 6, at which point I had access to 2 level 3 charges. This allowed me to learn magic like Fire2 or Lit2 that would hit every enemy for 40 to 120 damage, in an area where enemies have between 60 to 140 HP. 
                    <br><br>
                    While powerful on its own, and certainly capable of wiping an entire screen of enemies if the INT stat wasn’t bugged, the amount of spell charges, even the lower level ones for a spells like Ice1 that would hit for 20 to 80 damage per enemy, stand in no relation to the amount of encounters you run into during your quest through this particular area, as well as every other area that comes before and after. Worse even, you cannot replenish them unless you use a cottage (expensive, World Map only, i.e. not usable in dungeons) or rest at an inn (moving back to town, more encounters to fight, etc.). There are no ethers in this game! 
                    <br><br>
                    What this results in is that either you’re holding onto your charges for situations that never arrive, saving them for the bossfight or running out of them early on in a new dungeon. This ended up making the black mage feel useless for the large majority of fights, because their physical strength adds nothing to a fight, and the difficult parts of the game, i.e. getting through dungeons, were more difficult for it. Effective usage of the black mage very much seems to depend on prior knowledge of the area - what enemies am I going to be fighting, which ones should I be looking out for? However, even considering a combination of well-utilized spells, a lot of escaping from fights that are just not worth it, and a good helping of additional levels through grinding, I can’t see the black mage’s pure magic damage output, or any mage’s for that matter, be more helpful in the long run in comparison to a non-magic-reliant class. In fact, a mage’s support abilities like Saber, a spell that raises a character’s ATK power, or Haste, a spell that increases the amount of hits a unit does per attack, seemed to be a better choice for damage than any direct-damage spells in their entire repertoire. Consider also the fact that these spells share the same level and charges with spells that can be used to attack multiple enemies. If you’re afraid of boss fights or particularly nasty one-monster trap fights, a threat that is very real, you’re lessening the mages’ unique utility of having the option to attack multiple enemies at once by saving charges for potent single-target spells for those encounters. 
                    <br><br>
                    This issue is alleviated about 2/3rds into the game, at which point you get equipment that comes with innate spell effects that can be used by “using” the equipped item as an item within the Item command. These items have spells equivalent to Level 3 spells on them, such as Fire2 or Lit2, nullifying any kind of cost you would otherwise pay for these, offering a source of consistent encounter-wide damage. The issue then becomes: Why use anything but these items? At this stage in the game, you are essentially circumventing the spell charge system for encounter-wide spells and turn those charges into fodder for single-target only spells, such as the aforementioned support spells. 
                    <br><br>
                    I want to question the remaining purpose of the class at this stage in the game: They can still use their charges for support spells, single-target spells, or higher tier area-wide spells, perhaps spells that cause instant death instead of doing damage (risky), but those spells are still limited by spell charges, and with dungeons getting longer and longer, with no spell charge growth rate or increased max charge cap to match, those options simply won’t see much use. Furthermore, the item that allows them to cast Fire2 for free can also be worn by Ninjas. Additionally, the Lit2 item, doing similar damage, is equippable by Warriors/Knights, both classes also far outpacing the black mage in consistent single target damage, while now also having the option to adopt a niche that only mages were occupying previously. Essentially, a class that was already struggling to fulfill one of its unique utilities has had it destroyed through equipment. Of course, if you already have a mage in your party, all this does not matter, as you’re stuck with them anyway. In terms of how this class progresses, however, it does not make a whole lot of sense to me.

                    Another point to consider that works against my enjoyment of black mage is the money required to keep them fully stocked with spells. While there’s barely any armor or equipment in general to buy for them, the cost of magic is more than a match for keeping, for example, a Warrior fully equipped, if you’re interested in getting more than one spell for each charge level. Considering that the vast majority of items in chests are also for, or at least usable by, the Warrior, a majority of the funds will be spent on spells that, as discussed above, don’t offer much to the party.

                    I think it is safe to say that I don’t particularly enjoy having mages around, despite their cool looks. For the record: Some of the black mage centric complaints can also be thrown at the feet of the white mage. Their heals exist, but you cannot spam them endlessly. Especially with Warriors around, a lot if not most of your charges will be spent to get one of them from next to nothing to full again. Additionally, much like the Fire2/Lit2 items, there’s also party-wide healing equipment in the form of the Healing Helmet and the Healing Staff, offering party-wide small heals for no cost beyond the use of a character’s turn.

                    What I will have to say to the white mage’s credit, however, is that their Dia spells, offensive spells that only deal damage to the undead, are a lot more potent than an equivalent level black magic spell and can easily wipe an entire enemy formation despite the bugged stats, provided all enemies are undead. Additionally, they’re the only ones who can revive dead units in the middle of a dungeon, as there is no Phoenix Down to go around, and they’re the only ones who can learn Exit, a spell that allows you to exit a dungeon immediately. These support spells are genuinely valuable, as they can allow you to recover from a deadly encounter or at least flee the dungeon to save. Last but not least, support spells like Exit or any of the Null-spells are unique to them and are much more distinct from the black mage’s. That, in my view, absolutely makes them a job choice that I am happy with.
